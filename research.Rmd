The goal of my research is to predict and improve _Helicobacter pylori_-associated outcomes as well as screening and prevention for gastrointestinal cancers, particularly in the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and liver. These cancers have dismal case-fatality rates. By leveraging electronic health record data and genomic data, I identify populations at risk to improve detection of cancer and clinical care. Through modeling screening and prevention strategies, I develop clinical management decision aids. 

# Selected Research Projects

1. *Predicting and improving _Helicobacter pylori_-associated Outcomes*

2. *Cost-effectiveness modeling gastric cancer screening strategies*
